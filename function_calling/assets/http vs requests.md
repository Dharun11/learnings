## Difference Between `http.client` and `requests` in Python

Both `http.client` and `requests` are used to make HTTP requests in Python, but they differ in usage, abstraction level, and features.

---

### `http.client`

* **Built-in** Python standard library (no need to install).
* **Low-level API**: You handle connections, headers, and parsing manually.
* Good for **maximum control** over the HTTP protocol.
* Syntax is **verbose** and less intuitive.

**Example:**

```python
import http.client

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("jsonplaceholder.typicode.com")
conn.request("GET", "/todos/1")
response = conn.getresponse()
print(response.status, response.reason)
data = response.read()
print(data)
conn.close()
```

---

### `requests`

* **Third-party** library (`pip install requests`).
* **High-level API**: Human-friendly and intuitive.
* Handles sessions, cookies, redirects, JSON, SSL, etc. automatically.
* **Most popular** choice for API consumption in Python.

**Example:**

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
print(response.status_code, response.reason)
print(response.json())
```

### Comparison Table

| Feature               | `http.client`          | `requests`                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Built-in**          | Yes                    | No (install via pip)                |
| **Abstraction Level** | Low-level              | High-level                          |
| **Ease of Use**       | Verbose, manual        | Simple, concise                     |
| **API Features**      | Basic HTTP(S) requests | Rich: sessions, cookies, JSON, etc. |
| **SSL Handling**      | Manual/explicit        | Automatic                           |
| **Typical Usage**     | Rare, for fine control | Everyday API work                   |
| **Code Size**         | More boilerplate       | Minimal, readable                   |

---

### TL;DR

* Use **`requests`** for most HTTP/API tasks.
* Use **`http.client`** only when you need low-level control or want no dependencies.
