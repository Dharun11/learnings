1st 
creating a server
in weather.py
    We are calling a weather api to get the weather news via async
    next we are formatting the response of the api result above as per our convineance 
    NEXT Important thing
        TO CREATE ANY MCP TOOL 
            USE @mcp.tool() DECORATOR ABOVE THE FUNCTION -> BECOME MCP TOOL
        we are creating a MCP TOOL , again an another function using async which may be api call  also THIS IS MY TOOL/SERVICE
        here in this function the DOC STRING is very important , via this doc string the llm is able to understand when a specific request comes

NOW WE SUCCESSFULLY CREATED THE MCP TOOL / SERVER
LIKE THIS WE CAN CREATE AS MANY AS WE WANT

    HERE MY HOSTS CREATE A MCP CLIENT 
        hosts can be anything
            - streamlit app
            - fastapi app
            - flask app

            - claude desktop
            - mcp inspector
            - terminal
     SO WITH THESE HOSTS WE CAN CREATE A MCP CLIENT 
        THESE CLIENT -> MCP SERVER -> CAN DEAL WITH TOOLS 

     FIRST WE RUN THIS VIA MCP inspector
        STEPS TO FOLLLOW
            - uv run mcp dev file_name ( uv run mcp dev server/weather.py)
